The game is designed for two person but it doesn't matter, if you don't have another human player. Due to the simplicity of the production, the game will be looking exactly the same, it doesn't matter who you're playing against!

## Instruction

#### Example nr 1:

          Jan[8]: 4â™¥ (4)
          PaweÅ‚[9]: Jâ™£ (11)

Everything works as follow. Beginning on the left, you will see a player name, moving right you will see his/her/its total score in this game, given in square brackets. The player who will have greater total score after the deck is empty - wins! Next, there's a colon but it's completely negligible and appears there only because of aesthetic reasons. Going further to the right you will notice a number or a letter - that's a rank of your card! It's follow by it's suit, in a form of a nice Unicode character. The last value, which is contained in round brackets is "power" of your actual hand. The player with greater score in this particular parenthesis wins the deal and gains **1 point**!

#### Example nr 2:

          Jan[12]: 10â™£ (10)
          PaweÅ‚[11]: 10â™¥ (10)

          WAR OUTBREAK!!!

          Jan[12]: 10â™£ ðŸ‚ 
          PaweÅ‚[11]: 10â™¥ ðŸ‚ 
          Jan[12]: 10â™£ ðŸ‚  8â™£
          PaweÅ‚[11]: 10â™¥ ðŸ‚  9â™¥
          Jan[12]: 8â™£ (8)
          PaweÅ‚[11]: 9â™¥ (9)

Sometimes it could happen that you and your opponent will have the same "power" in a deal. It'll lead to the massive conflict called **WAR**. But don't worry, it's incredibly simple game and everything will happens as follow. Both of you will throw an extra card in but it will remain covered! Then, you will throw one more card in but this time, the card will be graded by my extremely sophisticated algorithm, which will result in displaying a new "power". And as in an ordinary deal, the player with higher power wins, gaining this time whole **3 points**!

That's it. Have a nice game and don't overwork your Enter button!
